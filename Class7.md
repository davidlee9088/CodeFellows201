# Class 7 Notes 
## Domain Modeling
1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
Domain model is needed to process of creating conceptual model in coding. A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.
## HTML table Basics
1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
Few reasons why you should not use HTML page layouts. Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users. Tables produce tag soup. Tables are not automatically responsive
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
- h1 is used to emphsaisze upon the header, the most importnat one.
- p is used to add extra spacing between page elements, rahther than defining acutal paragraphs.
- cite is used to cite a web resource. 
## introducing constructors
1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
constructor is automatic way to complete few coding styles. The advantages are ,Automatic initialization of objects at the time of their declaration.
Multiple ways to initialize objects according to the number of arguments passes while declaration.
2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
it is differed as Object literal upon one object rather for constructor you can create multiple and automatic declartion.
## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience
prototype is the main object and small branches come out from the prototype. From X to X.block, X.red , X.blue and etc. The main prototype was X, however, there are smaller break type as more defined upon what the object's meaning. I had to use prototypes when breaking down few buttons. I had few buttons to use, and with using protoype and inheritance, I was able to adjust given to either all the buttons or certain buttons.
