## JavaScript Object Basics
1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions. 
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
create an object using an object literal when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database. Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. Arrays are list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list. 
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.
You can access properties on an object by specifying the name of the object, followed by a dot (period) followed by the property name. You will use the bracket to call from the index upon the array.
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this? this refers to calling the data from the set vars. For exameple, firs this would call upon the name of the var and second this will call upon the data age. Within the {} it would multiply *7 and show dog's age equlivent to human age.
## Introduction To The DOM
1. What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. 
2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
## things I want learn more
- What are some ways I can use the knoweldge of Dom to Javascript personally? 
- What are some other effective ways to study using array other than coding
