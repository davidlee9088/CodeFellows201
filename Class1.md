- First step to design is to create HTML format for the web.
- The most important question to answer for the design is the what is the main goal of the website, and what is it suppose to do
- H1 should be used over Span because H1 is designated for header, however, Span can be used for any thing.

- JavaScript has to make sure the values are correct, with correct strings, ray, etc
- You can add Javascript to HTML three different ways. First way is external sheet by creating .js folder within the same location of HTML and CSS. Inline Javascript will work on html page. Internal is creating a script tag within the head on HTML.
