## Learn HTML
Creating Hyperlinks

- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
to wrap text or other contents inside, it would be block level links.
- The href attribute contains what information?
href contains also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
- What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
If a title's information is truly important to the usability of the page, then you should present it in a manner that will be accessible to all users, for example by putting it in the regular text.

## CSS

- What is meant by “normal flow”?
normal flow means webpage elemenets lay themelves out if nothing has been changed. The basic flow of the imgs, or text.

- What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
Block Level blocks the whole page of the section. Inline elements are section of the block level element, and it can be overflowed compare to block level.

- ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
I am not exactly sure how to response to this question however, I think the answer is normal positioning. Normal flow style normal positioning.

- Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
Few advantages of using absolute positioning are absolute positing the element based on its relative position within the normal document flow, they specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides.
- What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. (An exception to this occurs if one of the element's ancestors is a fixed containing block because its transform property has a value other than none.) 

## JS
- Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
Function declaration is more like naming the function. Just because you have named someone, that someone will not change. However, function invocation is calling that person for an action after you named them. Invocation will actually do the action, and declare is just naming the function.
- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes. However arguments can not be parameters. Parameters are values that will be passed through function. The arguments are the actual values

## Miscellaneous
Two benfits are reducing time on same project when one person can take one section and other section. Another person will lead on each sections which will gives more input to each other on which sections on they lead since they can focus on smaller section. Another benefits are giving vision to another person on what they can't see. For an example, it's easier to see other person's mistake with one more pair of eyes.
