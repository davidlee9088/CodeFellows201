## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax errors are some simple mistakes rather it can be spelling error, or ; or even some kind of [],{} errors that you have missed place. However, Logic Error is something that logic does not make sense. For an example if a === b is true then run a fuction however, in logic error it would be something like this. c === d and run same function when the value does not match. Computer does not know what it means, and it would create a logic error when there is a function you want to run however, the logic does not make sense.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
Many freuqenet Syntax erros have occured. For me, I would assign a value to a name, and when I was trying to recall the name of the value, I would spell it differnelty or give a new name. I was able to correct them by reading the lines from top and below slowly and run console.log upon few lines each to see what result I get. 
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
this topic will continue to influnce my longterm career because everyone makes mistakes. The stories I hear is that even Senior Developers make simple mistakes that can be fixed by changing one sign and it took them hours to figure it out. I have to realize take things slow and be careful upon doing anything and this can be succesful to my career since that would reduce my time when I have to fix an error.

## Javascript Debugger
1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
debugger allows us to see what variables are not working, and how they are named. Simple way to expalin is there is spell check, and grammer check upon our system that runs and checks for us. If there is an error of not correct spelling or grammer it would let us know where that issue is located.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.
breakpoint is to set a pause on running execution that has occured. Simple way to explain is once you put a break on a function, it would cut of the function and stop right there. It would not go further.
3. What is the call stack?
Call stack is section to show you what things have happended to get that line of code. In a simple way, it is to show the buliding blocks of base.

### things I want to learn more 
- When is it useful to use breakpoint compare to return or even break? What are some real life scenearios that people have used breakpoint to fix their code?
