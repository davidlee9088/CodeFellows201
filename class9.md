Event listeners is something that reacts to user. For an example, when we click login, the system process the users input and logs in. Simple as that. An active thing user does that triggers the system

two arguments are how the system will be triggered, and what does the system do after the trigger.
3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
parameter specified with a name such as event, evt, or e. This object can be useful because automatically passes the event object as parameter to the information that is needed.
4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
Event bubbling and capture are terms that describe phases in how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements. For capturing the event will climb up the ladder from the event to reach the most parent of the element causing to show the path then capture the info. Bubbling captures the info first then moves on to the parents.
